            ABOUT FETHOME DISCREET CLUB

            <p className="text-sm">
              Fethome Discreet Club was founded in 2018 by award-winning
              professional dominatrix and kink educator Head mistress Garcia
              after over 12 years working in the industry.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              Till date, hundreds of power exchange fantasies have been enacted
              and explored within the walls of its authentic and immaculate play
              rooms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              The clubâ€™s vision of elevating professional BDSM to a higher level
              of service provision extends beyond the creation of an exceptional
              space, presenting our massive collection of hand-crafted BDSM
              toys, equipments and custom designed bondage furnitures in our
              various well designed play rooms many of which have been
              hand-crafted by local artisans .
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              The club is suited for almost any type of play you can imagine so
              that no fantasy goes unfulfilled, and our playspace has been
              designed to satisfy your most decedent and devious desires.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              We believe strongly that the complementary but opposing roles
              explored within erotic power exchange are symbiotic. Both Dominant
              and submissive are powerful in their own unique ways, and the
              experience that the two consensually engage in together should
              become greater than the sum of its parts, fulfilling both deeply.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              Whether you visit Fethome Discreet Club for a session, an event, a
              consultation, kink counselling, or any of our other services, we
              hope the experience becomes a memorable milestone in your own
              personal journey into kink.
